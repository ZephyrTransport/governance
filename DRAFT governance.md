## WHAT IS THE ZEPHYR FOUNDATION FOR ADVANCING TRAVEL ANALYSIS METHODS?

The Zephyr foundation is a 501(c)3 non-profit public charity organization incorporated in the United States of America, formed in 2016. The organization's mission is to advance rigorous transportation and land use decision-making for the public good by advocating for, facilitating, and supporting improved travel analysis and forecasting methods. 

The foundation serves as an independent legal entity to which community members can contribute code, funding, and other resources, secure in the knowledge that their contributions will be maintained for public benefit.

To serve this mission, the foundation has established the following goals:

* Support. Provide robust infrastructure, including financial, administrative, and legal support.

* Encourage. Encourage the use of open data standards, rigorous development practices, interoperability, reproducible research methods, and evaluation of research.

* Incubate. Incubate innovative and useful planning methods in preparation for deployment by regions, cities, and neighborhoods.

* Teach. Teach core competencies and next generation travel analysis skills to researchers and practitioners.

* Guide. Guide research towards useful avenues and products.

* Convene. Convene leading academics and practitioners to guide the Foundation’s efforts.

The foundation is organized around projects, also referred to as communities. Projects focus on different aspects of travel demand modeling and data analysis, with the ultimate goal of supporting good planning outcomes. The foundation therefore carries out its mission by executing projects, and by maintaining and sharing the products of these projects with the public at large.  Projects undertaken by the foundation should advance one or more of the foundation's goals.  The projects are conducted according to the etiquette and process established in the Bylaws and this narrative, and additional guidelines established on a project-by-project basis.  

While participating in the foundation's activities, which includes using its products, members, stakeholders and users agree to respect and follow the foundation's processes and Bylaws, and to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the foundation's mission.  Persons involved in the foundation's activities do so in a personal capacity, and never as representatives of the organizations they otherwise work or advocate for.  This means that users and contributors exercise good judgment in disclosing potential conflicts of interest, and also that members retain their foundation roles and responbilities irrespective of changes in their work association. 

## FOUNDATION STRUCTURE

The foundation is governed by the following entities:

* Board of Directors (Board), composed of members, which governs the foundation.

* Project Management Committees (PMC), which oversee projects.  PMCs are composed of stakeholders, users, and members. 

* Officers of the corporation, which are nominated by the Board and elected by the membership, and who conduct the foundation activities in specific areas (legal, financial, brand, fundraising, etc.).

* Members, who elect the Board, and propose and/or vote on motions that set the foundation policies and procedures.

#### BOARD OF DIRECTORS (BOARD)

The board is responsible for the management and oversight of the business and affairs of the corporation in accordance with the foundation Bylaws. This includes management of the corporate assets (funds, intellectual property, trademarks, and support equipment) and allocation of corporate resources to projects.

The Board selects projects for funding and establishes the PMCs that will guide each project or community.  The technical decision-making authority regarding the content and direction of the individual projects is not the responsiblity of the Board; instead, it is assigned to each respective PMC.

The Board has the faculty to terminate a PMC and/or replace a PMC chair at any time by resolution.  

The Board is composed of seven individuals, elected by the members of the foundation. Two to three members of the board are elected every year.

#### PROJECT MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES (PMC)

PMCs are established by resolution of the Board, to be responsible for the active management of one or more communities, which are also identified by resolution of the Board.  Each project is delegated authority to design its own technical charter and its own governing rules.  This delegation of technical guidance is intended to foster diversity of ideas and methods in the outcomes of the foundation's activities.  Project procedures must always comply with the Bylaws.

Each PMC is led by a chairperson, and in addition consists of at least one officer of the foundation.  The PMC may include one or more other members of the Foundation, at the discretion of the chair.

The chair of the PMC is appointed by the Board, has primary responsibility to the Board, and has the power to establish rules and procedures for the day-to-day management of the communities for which the PMC is responsible, including the composition of the PMC itself.  Section 6.3 of the Bylaws define a PMC and the position of chair. 

The primary role of the PMC is oversight -- not to develop the technical approach, but to ensure that all legal issues are addressed, that procedure is followed, and that each and every release is the product of the community as a whole.  Successful execution of this oversight role is a key component of the foundation's litigation protection mechanisms.

The PMC is also tasked with furthering the long term development and health of the community as a whole, and ensuring that balanced and wide-scale peer review and collaboration happen. PMCs shall activitely discourage communities centered around a few individuals who work virtually uncontested for long periods. We believe that this is detrimental to the quality, relevance, and robustness of products and the travel demand forecasting industry.

Members of PMCs are kept to a higher standard than all other members of the foundation. This is because the PMC, and the chair in particular, are directly responsible for the main activities carried out by the foundation.  The Board and the membership rely on the PMC to ensure that communities behave always in a lawful manner, and in accordance to the Bylaws and the mission and goals of the foundation.

The Zephyr Foundation takes many of its PMC concepts from the Apache Foundation. The [Apache Developer Information](https://www.apache.org/dev/) pages have many more details of how PMCs work.

#### OFFICERS
The Officers of the foundation oversee the day-to-day affairs of the Foundation. The officers are nominated by the Board of Directors and elected by the membership.

#### MEMBERS
Persons are appointed as members on the basis of merit, for the evolution and progress of the foundation. Members care for the foundation itself. This is usually demonstrated through project-related and cross-project activities. Legally, a member is a "shareholder" of the foundation; that is, one of its owners. Members have the right to elect the Board, to stand as a candidate for Board election and to nominate persons for membership. They also have the right to propose a new project for incubation. Members coordinate their activities through their mailing list and through their annual meeting.

## ROLES
The foundation operates as a meritocracy; that is, it is governed by members selected on the basis of ability.  And furthermore, governance responsibilities are accorded to individuals that have demonstrated commitment to contribute to the foundation mission and goals. 

Persons need not be foundation members to participate in projects.  Individuals can participate in project communities in several capacities:  

* Stakeholder
* User
* Contributor
* PMC member
* PMC chair

#### STAKEHOLDER
A stakeholder is someone that has an interest in the results of the project. They contribute to the Foundation projects by providing feedback to the PMC about the overall direction and needs of the project. Stakeholders participate in the foundation community by serving as subject matter resources.

#### USER
A user is someone that uses project products. Users can participate in the foundation community by helping other users, for example in user support forums, or by providing feedback to the PMC.

#### CONTRIBUTOR
A contributor is someone who contributes to a project in the form of data, code, analysis, ideas, reviews, methods, and/or documentation. Contributors are users that take extra steps to participate in a project, beyond simply being on the receiving end of the project products. Contributors are also known as developers.

#### PMC MEMBER
A PMC member is a stakeholder or user appointed due to merit for the evolution of the project and demonstration of commitment. PMC members have write and owner-level access to the project files, an organization email address, and the right to vote on community-related decisions (including formal release of the project products). PMC members are appointed by the PMC chair.

#### PMC CHAIR
The PMC chair is appointed by the Board and is tasked with establishing rules and procedures for the day-to-day management of the project community, including the composition of the PMC itself.

## PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION
Projects are managed using a collaborative, consensus-based process. The foundation does not have a hierarchical structure. Rather, different groups of contributors have different rights and responsibilities in the organization.

Since PMCs have the power to create their own self-governing rules, there is no single vision on how PMCs should run a project and the communities they host.

At the same time, while there are some differences, there are a number of similarities shared by all the projects and best practices that are suggested:

#### COMMUNICATION
Communication is done via emailing lists. These identify "virtual meeting rooms" where conversations happen asynchronously, which is a general requirement for groups that are so geographically distributed to cover all time zones (like it's normally the case for the various foundation communities).  Virtual meeting rooms can be a GitHub issue, an online shared document, or something else.

Some projects additionally use more synchronous messaging or video chats (for example, instant messaging, skype, or google hangout).

In general, asynchronous communication is much more important because it allows archives to be created and it's more tolerant on the volunteer nature of the various communities.

#### DOCUMENTATION
Each project is responsible for its own project website. Further information to assist committers, developers, and PMCs is available at [Infrastructure](https://www.apache.org/dev/infrastructure.html).

#### DECISION MAKING
Projects are normally auto-governing and driven by the people who volunteer for the job. This is sometimes referred to as "do-ocracy" -- power of those who do. This functions well for most cases.

When coordination is required, decisions are taken with a lazy consensus approach: a few positive votes with no negative vote is enough to get going.

Voting is done with numbers:

+1 -- a positive vote

0 -- abstain, have no opinion

-1 -- a negative vote

The rules require that a negative vote includes an alternative proposal or a detailed explanation of the reasons for the negative vote.

The community then tries to gather consensus on an alternative proposal that resolves the issue. In the great majority of cases, the concerns leading to the negative vote can be addressed.

This process is called "consensus gathering" and we consider it a very important indication of a healthy community.

Specific cases have some more detailed voting rules.

#### PHILOSOPHY
While there is not an official list, these six principles have been cited as the core beliefs of philosophy behind the foundation, which is normally referred to as "The Apache Way" and have been adapted for this Foundation:

* respectful, honest, technical-based interaction

* driven by usefulness

* user-friendly packaging and licensing

* consistently high quality work products

* faithful implementation of standards

* lawfulness as a mandatory feature

All of the foundation projects share these principles. Similarly, foundation projects are required to govern themselves independently of undue commercial influence.

#### OPERATION
All projects are composed of volunteers and nobody (not even members or officers) are paid directly by the foundation for their job. There are many examples of committers that are paid to work on the projects, but never by the foundation themselves, but rather by companies or institutions that use the software and want to enhance it or maintain it.

Note that the foundation does contract out various services, including accounting, Press and Media relations, and infrastructure system administration.

#### INDIVIDUALS COMPOSE THE FOUNDATION
All of the foundation including the board, the other officers, the committers, and the members, are participating as individuals. That is one strength of the foundation: affiliations do not cloud the personal contributions.

Unless they specifically state otherwise, whatever they post on any mailing list is done as themselves. It is the individual point-of-view, wearing their personal hat and not as a mouthpiece for whatever company happens to be signing their paychecks right now, and not even as a director of the foundation.

All of those foundation people implicitly have multiple hats, especially the Board, the other officers, and the PMC chairs. They sometimes need to talk about a matter of policy, so to avoid appearing to be expressing a personal opinion, they will state that they are talking in their special capacity. However, most of the time this is not necessary, personal opinions work well.

#### BALANCING CONFIDENTIALITY AND PUBLIC DISCUSSION
We endeavor to conduct as much discussion in public as possible. This encourages openness, provides a public record, and stimulates the broader community.

However sometimes internal private mail lists are necessary. You must never divulge such information in public without the express permission of the list. Also never copy an email between private and public lists (no Cc). Such an event would go beyond the normal need for email ettiquette and be a serious breach of confidence. It could have serious ramifications, cause unnecessary confusion and ill-informed discussion.

Private lists are typically only used for matters pertaining to people as individuals (like voting in new committers), and legal matters that require confidentiality.

## THE FOUNDATION INCUBATOR
In order for new projects to be created, the foundation created a project called Incubator which is responsible to help new efforts to join the foundation.

Since the meritocratic rules operate across the foundation from bottom to top, it is vital for the long-term stability of such a form of government, that the initial set of committers has to know very well the dynamics of such a system, as well as share the same philosophical attitude toward collaboration and openness that the foundation expects from its projects.

The incubator is responsible for:

* filtering the proposals about the creation of a new project or sub-project

* help the creation of the project and the infrastructure that it needs to operate

* supervise and mentor the incubated community in order for them to reach an open meritocratic environment

* evaluate the maturity of the incubated project, either promoting it to official project/ sub-project status or by retiring it, in case of failure.

It must be noted that the incubator (just like the board) does not perform filtering on the basis of technical issues. This is because the foundation respects and suggests variety of technical approaches. It doesn't fear innovation or even internal confrontation between projects which overlap in functionality.

The incubator filters projects on the basis of the likeliness of them becoming successful meritocratic communities. Example requirements for incubation are:

* a working codebase -- over the years and after several failures, the foundation came to understand that without an initial working codebase, it is generally hard to bootstrap a community. This is because merit is not well recognized by developers without a working codebase. Also, the friction that is developed during the initial design stage is likely to fragment the community.

* the intention to donate copyright of the software and the intellectual property that it may contain to the foundation -- this allows the foundation to obtain an irrevocable and permanent right to redistribute and work on the code, without fearing lock-in for itself or for its users.

* a sponsoring foundation member or officer -- this person will act as the main mentor, giving directions to the project, helping out in the day-to-day details and keeping contact with the incubator PMC.

The incubation period normally serves to estimate whether or not:

* the project is able to increase the diversity of its committer base and to play with the meritocratic rules of the foundation.

It might seem rather easy to achieve, but it must be remembered that in a volunteer and highly selective environment, attracting new committers is not automatic.

Diversity of associateship is important for two main reasons:

* it gives long term stability to the project development: in fact, with all the developers affiliated to the same entity, the chance of seeing all of them moving away from the project at the same time is much greater than with a community of individuals affiliated to unrelated entities.

* it gives a greater variety of technical visions: something that guarantees a better adherence to environment and user's needs, thus a higher change of finding real-life use of the software.

## IN REVIEW...
The Zephyr Foundation represents one of the best examples of an open organization that has found balance between structure and flexibility. We hope to emulate their success here. We strive to find balance between openness and economical feasibility. We hope to continue to provide inspiration for businesses, governments, education, and for other foundations.

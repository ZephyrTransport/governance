# Governance Document Highlights

## What is this?

This repository includes two DRAFT documents: [formal corporate bylaws](https://github.com/ZephyrTransport/governance/blob/53bd62f79d95a9caf6a68f30acf60f1c2f1de865/DRAFT%20bylaws.md) (which have yet to be reviewed and edited by a lawyer) and a [governance overview](https://github.com/ZephyrTransport/governance/blob/53bd62f79d95a9caf6a68f30acf60f1c2f1de865/DRAFT%20governance.md). The former is intended to be the document we file with Delaware (or some other state) when we become a corporation; the latter is intended to be a readable and engaging expression of our values and procedures.

## How many board members do the bylaws call for and what is there term?

The [bylaws call for seven board members](https://github.com/ZephyrTransport/governance/blob/53bd62f79d95a9caf6a68f30acf60f1c2f1de865/DRAFT%20bylaws.md#section-54-number) and each board member's [term is four years](https://github.com/ZephyrTransport/governance/blob/53bd62f79d95a9caf6a68f30acf60f1c2f1de865/DRAFT%20bylaws.md#section-55-election-and-term). To maintain stability on the board during the start up phase, two of the initial board members will serve two year terms; another two will serve three year terms; another two will serve four year terms; and one will serve a five year term. This approach ensures continuity in the board during the start up phase by ensuring that no more than two board members are elected in any given year. 


## How do the guidelines address the need for a diverse board and membership?

The [bylaws define a Diversity Officer](https://github.com/ZephyrTransport/governance/blob/53bd62f79d95a9caf6a68f30acf60f1c2f1de865/DRAFT%20bylaws.md#g-diversity-officer) with the following responsibilities:

> The Diversity Officers shall guide efforts to conceptualize, define, assess, nurture, and cultivate diversity within the corporation's directors, officers, and members. The Diversity Officer shall maintain records on the diversity of the corporation's directors, officers, and members and report on the diversity of the directors, officers, and members at the annual meeting of the members. The Diversity Officer shall be responsible for compliance with the corporations non-discrimination policy.

Please note that the bylaws do not require the Diversity Officer be named for the corporation to function, in deference to concerns about staffing support during the start-up phase.
